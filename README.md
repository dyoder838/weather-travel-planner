# weather-travel-planner

This is my weather travel planner

The goal of this project it to use an API to search and return weather information from a selected city

When the user inputs a city, the current weather populates, as well as a 5 day forecast. 

The search is saved on a side bar when another city is searched.

The user can refer back to a previously searched city in the side bar and the information will update.

All information will be saved on page refresh.
